Rust solutions for Project Rosalind
===================================

I am attempting to learn the Rust lanuage in my spare time.

I am doing problems from Project Rosalind to do new problems at the same time that I learn Rust.

Since I have already done many of the basic Project Euler, and SPOJ problems in other languages I selected Rosalind for this.

Who knows, I may even learn a little biology through osmosis.
