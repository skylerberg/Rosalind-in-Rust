#Rust solutions for Project Rosalind
I am attempting to learn the rust lanuage in my spare time.
I chose to do problems from Project Rosalind because I wanted to do new problems at the same time that I learn rust.
Since I have already done many of the basic Project Euler, and SPOJ problems in other languages I selected Rosalind for this.
Who knows, I may even learn a little biology through osmosis.
